# SoulSpark

> A therapeutic companion game focused on emotional well-being

## Overview

SoulSpark is an indie game that combines 3D exploration, a customizable companion (the Spark), and therapeutic mini-games to create a calming, supportive experience. Built with Three.js and designed as a Progressive Web App, it aims to provide mental wellness support in an engaging, interactive format.

## Current Status

SoulSpark is in **early development** (Phase 0). We are currently:

- Establishing stable Three.js rendering
- Building the foundational scene components
- Implementing core visual elements

**Current focus:** Debugging rendering issues and establishing a minimal viable scene.

## Core Vision

- **The Spark:** A responsive, customizable companion that provides emotional support
- **Enchanted Environments:** Ghibli-inspired natural worlds that react to emotional states
- **Therapeutic Gameplay:** Mini-games based on CBT and mindfulness techniques
- **Accessibility:** Available across devices via PWA technology
