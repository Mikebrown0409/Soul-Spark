## Current Status & Roadmap

SoulSpark is currently in the early stages of development (**Phase 0: Core Rendering & Stability**). Our immediate focus is establishing a stable rendering foundation and resolving core technical hurdles.

For a detailed breakdown of planned features and development phases, please see our [**ROADMAP.md**](ROADMAP.md).

## Getting Started (Development)

_(Prerequisites: Node.js, npm/yarn)_

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Mikebrown0409/Soul-Spark.git
    cd Soul-Spark
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies (if any added later):**
    ```bash
    # npm install  (or yarn install)
    ```
3.  **Run a local development server:**
    *   We recommend using a simple server that can handle module loading correctly. The [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) dev server is excellent for Three.js projects, or use a basic option like `http-server` or Python's `http.server`.
    *   Example using `http-server` (install via `npm install -g http-server`):
        ```bash
        http-server . -o
        ```
    *   Navigate to `index.html` in your browser.
