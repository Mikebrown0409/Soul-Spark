# 2. Target Audience and Market Analysis

This document outlines the target audience for SoulSpark and analyzes the market landscape, focusing on the companion-centric approach.

## Market Analysis: Companion Focus

**Goal:** Identify existing solutions, gaps, and the potential audience for a game where the companion is the central feature.

**Existing Solutions & Weaknesses:**
- **Woebot:** Text-based AI chatbot (CBT). Lacks visual/immersive companionship, not a game.
- **Replika:** Customizable AI companion. Not gamified, basic avatar, lacks structured mental health goals.
- **Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp:** Friendly NPC animals. Not designed for mental health, interactions lack therapeutic depth.
- **Exploration Games (e.g., Journey to the Savage Planet):** AI guides/pets. Companions are secondary, minimal emotional/therapeutic role.
- **Virtual Pets (e.g., Tamagotchi):** Nurturing mechanics. Limited interaction depth, no explicit mental health focus.

**Gap in the Market:**
No existing mobile game fully integrates a dynamic, emotionally intelligent companion with:
- **Therapeutic Intent:** Evidence-based techniques (CBT, mindfulness) via a supportive friend.
- **Immersive Gameplay:** Three.js 3D visuals and narrative mechanics.
- **Viral Appeal:** Visually striking, customizable, shareable companion (#MyCompanionChallenge).
- **Gaming Depth:** Rich game world with exploration, puzzles, storytelling (appealing to gamers and non-gamers).

## Potential Audience

Emphasis on emotional connection.

**Primary Audience:**
- **Age:** 18–44 (Aligns with gamer average, includes younger adults seeking mental health support).
- **Gender:** Slightly female-leaning (higher reported anxiety), but universal appeal via customization.
- **Interests:** Casual gamers, mental health advocates, individuals seeking digital connection.
- **Pain Points:** Stress, anxiety, loneliness; desire for fun, accessible, non-judgmental support.

**Secondary Audience:**
- **Teens (13–17):** High stress/loneliness. Attracted to customizable companions (requires parental controls).
- **Older Adults (45+):** Growing interest in mental health apps for stress relief.

**Geographic Focus:**
- North America (Largest mental health app market)
- Asia-Pacific (Large gamer population, e.g., China)
- Europe (Growing mental health app markets, e.g., Germany)

**Size Estimate:**
- Potential Audience: 500 million+ (based on 2.6B gamers & 31.9% global anxiety prevalence).
- Target Active Users (2-3 years): 50–100 million, driven by the universal appeal of the companion.
