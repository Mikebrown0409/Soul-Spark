# 4. Technical Implementation Overview

This document outlines the core technologies and implementation approach for SoulSpark.

## Core Technology: Three.js

- **Purpose:** Power the 3D visuals of the Soul Cosmos and the Spark companion using WebGL.
- **Capabilities Utilized:**
    - **3D Rendering:** Dynamic biomes (e.g., Nebula Fields with volumetric fog, Crystal Canyons with reflective shaders).
    - **Procedural Generation:** Potential use for creating unique world variations per player.
    - **Spark Animation:** Particle systems and morph targets for fluid, mood-based transformations (e.g., spiky for anxiety, soft for calm).
    - **Real-time Lighting & Shaders:** Enhance emotional cues and environmental effects (e.g., storm clearing).
    - **Camera Controls:** Smooth navigation via intuitive touch gestures (swipe, pinch, tap).
    - **Interaction:** Raycasting for object interaction (puzzles, petting Spark).

## Platform & Delivery: Progressive Web App (PWA)

- **Goal:** Ensure broad accessibility across iOS, Android, and web browsers.
- **Benefits:**
    - **Cross-Platform:** Single codebase reaches multiple platforms.
    - **Installable:** Can be added to the home screen like a native app.
    - **Offline Capabilities:** Potential for core features to work offline (requires careful design).
    - **Discoverability:** Accessible via web search and potentially app stores.
- **Technology:** Standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) leveraging Three.js for the core experience.

## Performance Considerations

- **Target:** Smooth performance (e.g., aiming for 60 FPS) on mid-range mobile devices (e.g., iPhone 12 equivalent).
- **Optimization Strategies:**
    - **Level of Detail (LOD):** Simplify models/effects based on distance.
    - **Shader Complexity:** Offer options or automatic scaling for lower-end devices.
    - **Asset Management:** Efficient loading and unloading of textures and models.
    - **Draw Call Reduction:** Techniques like geometry instancing and texture atlases.

## Potential Additional Technologies

- **Lightweight LLM:** For Spark's dialogue (on-device or cloud-based API, TBD based on performance/cost/privacy).
- **Backend:** For user accounts, social features (SparkShare), data persistence (Node.js, Python/Django, etc. - TBD).
- **Database:** To store user progress, customizations, social data (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc. - TBD).
- **AR Integration:** Libraries like AR.js or platform-specific APIs (ARKit/ARCore) for the SparkShare AR feature.
