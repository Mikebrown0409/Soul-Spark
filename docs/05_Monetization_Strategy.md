# 5. Monetization Strategy

This document outlines the planned approach for generating revenue while maintaining user trust and accessibility.

## Core Principles

- **Value-Driven:** Monetization should feel fair and optional, enhancing the experience rather than gating core therapeutic benefits.
- **Ethical:** Avoid exploitative mechanics (e.g., loot boxes, pay-to-win). Be transparent about monetization.
- **Accessibility:** The core game and therapeutic features remain free.

## Monetization Streams

1.  **Free-to-Play (F2P) Base Game:**
    - Access to core gameplay, Spark companion, initial story chapters, basic customizations, and therapeutic mini-games.
    - **Optional Ads:** Infrequent, skippable rewarded video ads (e.g., watch an ad for extra GlowPoints or a cosmetic item). Carefully integrated to minimize disruption.

2.  **In-App Purchases (IAPs): Cosmetic Customizations:**
    - Focus on aesthetic upgrades for the Spark companion.
    - Examples: Unique colors, patterns, particle effects, accessories (e.g., halos, trails, hats), environmental decorations for the Orb Garden.
    - Pricing: Small, discrete purchases (e.g., $0.99 - $4.99 per item/pack).
    - **No Gameplay Advantage:** Purchases are purely cosmetic and do not affect therapeutic outcomes or progression speed significantly.

3.  **SoulSpark Pro Subscription (Optional):**
    - **Price:** Target $4.99/month (or regional equivalent), with potential annual discount.
    - **Benefits:**
        - **Exclusive Content:** Access to premium Spark forms, exclusive cosmetic items, and bonus story arcs or side quests.
        - **Ad-Free Experience:** Removes all optional ads.
        - **Offline Play:** Enhanced offline capabilities (if technically feasible).
        - **Cloud Save Slots:** Potentially more slots for saving game states or Spark configurations.
        - **Supporter Badge:** In-game indicator showing support.

4.  **Charity Tie-In:**
    - **Commitment:** Pledge a percentage of profits (e.g., 10%) to recognized mental health charities.
    - **Transparency:** Clearly communicate this commitment to users to build trust and brand loyalty.

5.  **Potential Future Sponsorships:**
    - **Model:** Partner with aligned wellness or mental health brands for sponsored content (e.g., a branded relaxation mini-game or sponsored Spark accessory).
    - **Integration:** Must be non-intrusive and clearly disclosed as sponsored.
    - **Ethical Vetting:** Sponsors must align with the game's values.

## Rationale

- The F2P model with cosmetic IAPs and an optional subscription balances accessibility with revenue generation.
- Focusing on cosmetics avoids pay-to-win criticism and respects the therapeutic nature of the game.
- The subscription offers clear value for engaged players without locking essential features.
- The charity tie-in strengthens the brand's mission-driven identity.
