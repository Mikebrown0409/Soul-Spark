# 6. Marketing and Virality Plan

This document details the strategy for launching SoulSpark, acquiring users, and fostering organic growth through viral mechanics.

## Core Strategy: Companion-Led Virality

Leverage the customizable, shareable Spark companion as the primary driver of organic growth and social buzz.

## Key Initiatives & Tactics

1.  **Pre-Launch / Launch Campaign: "Light Up Your Soul"**
    - **Teaser Content:** High-quality videos and screenshots showcasing the Spark's visual appeal (Three.js), customization, and emotional interactions.
    - **Influencer Partnerships:** Collaborate with gaming, mental health, and lifestyle influencers on platforms like TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, and X.
        - Provide early access for reviews and sponsored content.
        - Co-create Spark designs or challenges.
    - **PR & Media Outreach:** Target gaming and wellness publications with the unique angle of a therapeutic companion game.
    - **App Store Optimization (ASO):** Optimize keywords (e.g., "companion game," "stress relief," "anxiety app," "3D pet," "mindfulness game"), icon (featuring a glowing Spark), screenshots, and video trailers.

2.  **Viral Loop: #MySparkChallenge & SparkShare**
    - **#MySparkChallenge:**
        - Encourage players to design unique Sparks and share them on social media (TikTok, X, Instagram) using the hashtag.
        - Run contests with in-game rewards (premium customizations, GlowPoints) for the most creative/popular Sparks.
        - Partner with influencers to kickstart and amplify the challenge.
    - **SparkShare Hub:**
        - Facilitate easy sharing of Spark designs, moments (quotes, animations), and AR experiences directly from the game.
        - Feature user-generated content within the app (e.g., "Spark of the Week").
        - Foster community interaction (support boards) to create network effects.
    - **AR Integration:** Allow users to view and share their Spark in the real world via AR, creating highly shareable content ("Look who visited me today! #MySpark").

3.  **Cultural Movement Building:**
    - **Brand Identity:** Position SoulSpark not just as a game, but as a tool for emotional connection and well-being.
    - **Merchandise:** Potential for physical merchandise (Spark plushies, pins, apparel) to extend brand presence.
    - **Community Events:** In-game events (e.g., seasonal festivals, global relaxation moments) and potentially real-world tie-ins (e.g., virtual Spark projections at events).
    - **Charity Partnerships:** Actively promote the mental health charity partnerships to reinforce the brand's mission.

4.  **Paid User Acquisition (Post-Launch):**
    - **Targeted Ads:** Use platforms like Meta, Google Ads, TikTok Ads targeting interests in casual gaming, mental health, wellness, and specific demographics.
    - **Creative Focus:** Ad creatives centered on the Spark's appeal, customization, and emotional support aspects.
    - **KPIs:** Track Cost Per Install (CPI), Retention Rates, Conversion Rate (to IAP/Subscription), ROAS.

5.  **PR Stunts & Experiential Marketing:**
    - **High-Impact Launch Events:** Ideas like projecting user Sparks in 3D at iconic locations (e.g., Times Square) to generate significant media buzz.
    - **Interactive Installations:** Pop-up experiences where people can interact with a virtual Spark.
