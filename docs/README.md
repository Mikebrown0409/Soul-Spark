## Overview
SoulSpark is a 3D mobile game where players bond with a customizable, emotionally intelligent companion—a Spark—guiding them through a vibrant, cosmic world. The game blends exploration, light puzzles, and therapeutic activities (CBT, mindfulness) into a heartfelt journey to manage stress and anxiety. The Spark is the emotional anchor and core mechanic, evolving with the player and offering encouragement, humor, and wisdom.

3. **Check `contributing.md`** for how to propose changes, report issues, or join discussions.

## Alignment Principles
- The Spark companion is the heart of the game—every feature should reinforce emotional connection and therapeutic value.
- Visuals, gameplay, and narrative must be accessible, inclusive, and emotionally resonant.
- Evidence-based mental health support is non-negotiable; all therapeutic features must be validated.
- Virality and shareability are core to growth—design for moments players want to share.
